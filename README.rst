Run a python script or function only once in a given time frame.

If, for example, you have a script or service which might be called frequently, but you want to report errors only once daily to not annoy people too much, `once` is the library for you.

Quickstart
----------

Suppose you want your script to complain, but not more than once a day. `once.daily` is the tool you need::

    import once

    @once.daily
    def complain():
        print("This is not right!")

Now you can run `complain` as often as you want, from the same python script or from others, it will only be run at
most once a day, so that at least 24 hours are between two complaints.

If you want to complain more or less often, there are other variants:

=================  ==========
object             time delta
=================  ==========
`once.weekly`      1 week
`once.daily`       1 day
`once.hourly`      1 hour
`once.minutely`    1 minute
`once.Once()`      custom `datetime.timedelta`
=================  ==========

Advanced Usage
--------------

Instead of using a `once.Once` object as a decorator, you can also access it directly via the `check_ready()` and
`check_ready_trigger()` functions::

    import once
    import datetime

    once_every_two_hours = once.Once(datetime.timedelta(hours=2))

    if once_every_two_hours.check_ready():
        print("More than two hours have passed since last run!")

    if not_a_dry_run and once_every_two_hours.check_ready_trigger():
        print("More than two hours have passed since last run - triggering timer and running!")

Note that all instances of `once.Once` with the same time delta share the same timer, but those with different
time deltas don't share the timer. So, if you have never run anything before, this::

    import once
    import datetime

    @once.minutely
    def run_minutely():
        print("minutely")

    @once.hourly
    def run_hourly():
        print("hourly")

    @once.Once(datetime.timedelta(minutes=60))
    def run_every_60_minutes():
        print("60 minutes")

    run_minutely()
    run_hourly()
    run_every_60_minutes()

will print "minutely" and "hourly", but not "60 minutes", because 60 minutes is the same as one hour,
so the 60 minutes timer will already be triggered by `run_hourly` and `run_every_60_minutes` will not be
run.
